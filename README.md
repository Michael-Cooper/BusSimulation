# BusSimulation
Written in Java


A program used to simulate a bussing system in order to better understand bus-stop wait times, and how many busses might be needed given different passenger volumes within the system.

The program uses an event-scheduling approach to efficiently deal with the passage of time within the simulation, implementing a priority queue to handle these events.
